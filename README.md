# Mannele

Mannele (Alsacian name for [Stutenkerl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stutenkerl)) is a Discord bot for the University of Strasbourg students. It currently displays live transit schedules around our university but may evolve to provide additional data such as weather and pollution alerts or university related infos.

![A screenshot showing the Bot response to calling the slash command for getting station schedules. The response includes a header with station name with an emoji representing the specific station (for instance the observatory station has a telescope emoji). Then under the header you can find lane stop times. Lanes are grouped by wether they are tramway lanes or bus lanes (once again an emoji is also present with the text to illustrate it). Each lane shows lane arrival times for each direction. Lane arrival times are specified in minutes. When a lane is soon to arrive the text is replaced with "Now".](screenshots/botresponse.png)
